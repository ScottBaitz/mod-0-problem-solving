### Setup
- Fork this repository
- Clone your copy of it to your local machine

### Directions
Solve at least 3 of the challenges below. Create a file using the language for your program (`challenge1.rb` or `challenge1.js`) for each of the challenges you select. For each challenge you complete, include comments showing the **overall goal** in your own words, your **pseudocode**, and your **final solution**. 

1. Given a sentence with only lowercase letters, print the same sentence with the first letter of every word capitalized. For example, if you were given "Turing is the best", return "Turing Is The Best" instead!
